      Fix colour output for postscript.
      Fix scaling for Postscript bounding box; now matches image scaling.
       [Thanks Klaus Wirl]
      Parse empty double-quoted strings (e.g. label="") and allow double
       quotes in strings if escaped (e.g. label="hello\"there").
       [Thanks to Alexei Alexandrov for requesting this]
      Add some info about building on Solaris
       [Thanks to Robert Batusek and Jakub Vavra for helping with this]

0.12: Fix version number being truncated (was reported as 0.1).
       [Thanks to Graham Addis for spotting this]
      Add REMOVE_PNG_OUPUT to allow building without PNG support as a
       workaround for a packaging problem with gd-devel on Fedora 8.

       entites.  Add support for double lined arcs.
        [Thanks to Joon Sung Chun for the patch]

       definitions to allow default colours to be set on arcs originating
       from some entity.
      Change ADraw colour model to RGB.  Allow colours to be specified as
       #rrggbb values, or the 16 W3C HTML names.
      Simplify running of tests under Valgrind e.g.
         VALGRIND="valgrind -tool=memcheck" make test
      Linux builds use pkg-config to get gd dependencies and no longer
       static-link by default.  (Use STATIC=--static make for static objects).
        [Thanks Juliano F. Ravasi for the suggestion]
      Add more string replacements to make parse error reporting relate to
       input and not internal parser token names.
      Add 'width' global option to allow explicit setting of output chart
       width, rather than using a scale factor with hscale.
        [Thanks to Roger Spooner for the suggestion]
      Rename parser.a to libparser.a [Another from Juliano]
      Move CHANGES file up a directory.
      Add arcgradient option to allow arrows to slope, making direction of

        [Thanks to Roger Spooner for the patch]

0.11: Only render an arc ID on the first line out the label if it has more
       than one line (the ID would previously be duplicated on each line).
      Add support for multi-line entity title labels (use '\n' in the label
       to start a newline).
      Apply changes based on patches from Alban Crequy to support broadcast
       signals, where the destination entity is specified as "*", causing
       arcs to be rendered to all entities.
        [Thanks Alban Crequy for the patch]

0.10: Change sinf() and cosf() to sin() and cos() which are more widely
       supported, particularly SunOS 5.8

       Add initial SVG support.

0.8:  Extend parser and msc ADT to support global options.

      Re-check executable is Valgrind clean on Linux, when producing PS
       output.

0.7:  Remove 'else ifeq' in renderer Makefile.
       This requires GNU Make 3.81, which causes problems with older
       installations and Macs.
        [Thanks to Ian Lister]

      Remove printf output after parsing phase as the output isn't
       useful or interesting!

0.6:  Packaging changes only.

       deleted.

      Clarify some error message and make them distinct.
